Project 1

name:XuPengcheng
student_ID:518370910177


Function:
1.Input :
        1)we can now decide the numbers of the lanes
        2)we can decide the number of directions of roads
        3)we can generate the plate
        4) the time of red light
        5)the time of green light





2.Plotting the roads and lights

struct road
road=struct('width',{},'dir_n',{},'lane_n',{},'shape',{},...
            'size',{},'set',{},'midline',{},'midlines',{},'midlines_s',{});
%define the road as a struct
%dir_n is the number of directions
%lane_n is the number of lanes
%shape is a matrix to show how the 1/n of the road is plotted
%size is the size of shape matrix
%set is the whole set of all parts of road
%midline is 1 middle line of road
%midlines is the set of  a quarter of all the lanes of middle line of road
%midlines_s is the set of all middle lines of road



3.struct light
light=struct('position',{},'no',{},'color',{},...
             'size',{},'set',{},'tr',{},'tg',{});
%define the light as a struct
%tr is time of red
%tg is time of green



3.Set up the properties of cars

  struct car
car=struct('length',{},'width',{},...
    'no',{},...
    'plate',zeros(car_n),...
    'plate_lib',{},...
    'plate_n',{},...
    'car_type',{},...
    'shape',zeros(2,5),...
    'shapet',{},...
    'color',{},...
    'fill',{},...
    'fillcolor',{},...
    'velocity',{},...
    'changingv',{},...
    'ox',{},'oy',{},...
    'dx',{},'dy',{},...
    'oox',{},'ooy',{},...
    'odirection',{},...
    'direction2',{},...
    'violation',{},...
    'state',{},...
    'area',{},...
    'No_in_area',{},...
    'lane',{},...
    't0',{},...
    'boom',{});

%originally define a struct car,
%it's length is 2 ,width is 1,it's number
%plate is its plate number,shape is its shape:1 is rectangular,
%color is a char like 'r'
%fill is a 2*n matrix to describe the place to paint another color
%fillcolor is the color filled corresponding to "fill"
%velocity is originally set 0.1 units,
%changingv is a boolean 0 or values>0,if 0 it's not changingits speed
          %otherwise its value is its time start to change v
%ox,oy,is its center point's position, set up by ox and oy matrices
%oox,ooythe position change with respect to the light when reach crossing
%odirection is which way a car take originally,it's randomly generated in the range 1 to car_n 
%direction2 is which way a car NOW take(will be changed after turning)
%violation record whether the car will break traffic rules 1is violation,0 is not
%state is a varieble to express whether the car have crossed the road:
       %1: not crossed 2:stop at the crossing 3:at the crossing(straight) 4:turning right 5.turning left 6:have crossed
%area is to express where the cars are, there are road(1).dir_n  number of
       %road directions and 1 crossing
%No_in_area is the car No, in its area :an integer 
%t0 is the time the car starts to turn
%boom is to express whether the car bump into each other,0 is no ,n>=1 is
%the number it bumps into.


4.
Plotting the car motion

**can turn left or right
**will stop when red lights are on
**have special and real shapes
**have different color
**have different sizes
